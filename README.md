# one-dark-pro-modified-to-match-a-specific-powerpoint-theme README

This theme matches the colors in the visually appealing [Programming Language Workshop for Beginners theme](https://slidesgo.com/theme/programming-language-workshop-for-beginners#search-Programming&position-2&results-63). to remove error squiggles so that taking screenshots of incomplete code is easier, add the following in your settings.json:

```
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  "[One Dark Pro for PL ppt theme]": {
    "editorError.foreground": "#00000000"
  }
}
```
